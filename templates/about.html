    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <h2> Education</h2>
    <p1> I joined the University of Maryland in 2019 as a <em>Finance and Information Systems major</em>.
        I spent the first two years of my education focusing consulting. After an attempt at starting my own company,
        I discovered a passion of mine for Product Management. In pursuit of this career, I decided to switch my major
        to <em>Marketing and Information Systems</em>. Throughout my time here I was also able to work some jobs around campus
        such as being a Teaching Assistant and a Front Desk Worker at the Robert H. Smith School of Business. </p1>

        instruments. Some interests of mine include mashing songs, tasting foods around the world, and trying ice cream
        flavors.</p2>
